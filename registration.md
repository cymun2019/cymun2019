<h2>Registration Policy</h2>
<p style="line-height: 150%;">
This year, CYMUN will have two delegate registration rounds: <strong>Premium</strong> and <strong>Platinum</strong>. Anyone aged 13-22 is allowed to apply to be a Delegate in this conference. Applicants will need to fill out all the information in the form and wait for their application to be assessed by the Chairs and Content Developers for CYMUN 2019. We will base our evaluation solely on the content of your submission and your suitability for our Committees.
<br>
Continuing its previous endeavor, CYMUN 2019 will also feature <strong>Delegations</strong>, which are groups of Delegates representing a school or institution that attend the Conference together. Members of the Delegation will not necessarily have the same country allocation or committee allocation. Delegations will be automatically considered for <strong>Delegation awards</strong>.
